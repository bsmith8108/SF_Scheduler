README file

    This program is meant to create a random schedule for the Sherwood Forest Boys
and Girls Camp program. The schedule generator follows a very specific set of guidelines,
to help best create a schedule that can be usable by the camp director. Not only does this
program create a random schedule, it also creates powerful user interface, that allows the
created schedule to be modified and added to using the different tools provided. Some of
these tools include:                                                                             

Find Activity - which allows the user to select which activity they want to find and       
the program will then highlight all periods where that activity is present in a bright  
yellow color.                                                                           

Clear Find - This turns all of the different squares back to green, once you are done      
going over the different found activities. This tool will also turn all of the modified    
periods (the ones highlighted in blue) back to green so that it is easier to see the       
overall schedule.                                                                          

Add Activity - allows the user to add in another activity to the list of available        
activities. After adding another activity, the user can then click on the "Create New     
Schedule" button and the program will create a new schedule that also includes the      
new activity. This tool could also be useful for adding in special activities such as     
a trip for a certain group, since once the activity is added to the activities list     
it can then be accessed when you click on a period and want to change the activity.     
It will also be added to the Show Activities window.                                        

Show Activities - allows the user to view all of the different activities that are       
currently in the programs list of possible activities for the schedule. A way to verify   
that an added activity has actually been processed.

Update Equalization Matrix - updates the matrix for the equalization matrix using the
current schedule. This will update all of the relevant indexes for the next time you
run the program

Clear Matrix - resets the matrix to read 0 for all of the activities for all of the groups
for somebody looking to start it fresh.

Show Matrix - Shows the current matrix with the number of occurences for each activity
listed under the same heading and in the same line as the group name. This is updated
every time the user clicks update matrix

Export - saves the file as a text file that can be easily copy and pasted into an excel
sheet, most easily the the typical excel spreadsheet used for most schedules.

Test program - Simply runs the program and then updates the matrix five times in a row
and is a good way to see whether or not the equalization matrix is actually working or
not.

To edit the schedule all you must do is click on the period within the schedule and a dialog
will come up that will allow you to edit what is contained within that period and then it
will update it and highlight that cell in blue so that the user can see all of the ones
that it has modified. If there appears some red periods on the screen than there is an
error in how the schedule was created and the user needs to go through and solve that problem.
Unfortunately the scheduler is not perfect yet and still needs to be helped at some points.

Under the about tab is the help button, which will simply shows this README
